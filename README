Description: A partition or disk imaging/cloning tool customized from Clonezilla for GDMS
 Clonewar is a variant of Clonezilla, based on DRBL, Partclone, and udpcast, allows you to do bare metal backup and recovery. Two types of Clonezilla are available, Clonezilla live and Clonezilla SE (Server Edition). Clonezilla live is suitable for single machine backup and restore. While Clonezilla SE is for massive deployment, it can clone many (40 plus!) computers simultaneously.
